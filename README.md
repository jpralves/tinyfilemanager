# Tiny File Manager

This [fork](https://github.com/jpralves/tinyfilemanager) adds a number of additional options that were missing in the original Tiny File Manager.
I give credit to the original author but added the following enhancements:

- Docker images ready to be used. More instructions on this [document](README-docker.md).
- Ability to change owner of files and folders (Root run image)
- Added dynamic user variables to be used in docker images
- Updated external JS/CSS libraries to latest versions
- Show binary files in HEX dump format
- Support for webp images
- xz and bz2 compressed extension icons
- Markdown highlighting
- Edit empty files
- Fix problem in compression information
- Show Modify date in file information
- Show ownership in numeric uid:gid when username and/or group are not available
- Execute of commands/scripts for admin users
- LDAP authentication with membership authorization (bind-only mode) (Requires ldap extension)
- Manipulate special file bits (sticky, setuid, setgid)
- System information page in Help
- Partition Space usage in a progress bar
- Support for xattr (extended attributes) information of files (Requires pear xattr extension)
- Auditing information of operations
